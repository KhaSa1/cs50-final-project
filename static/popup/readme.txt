1. Overview
-----------

What is Corner Popup? It's a simple pop-up component that can be used on 
almost all modern websites. It simply displays small pop-up box in corner 
of the browser. Corner Popup is fully configurable and you can change many 
parameters - position, window color, content inside etc. Corner Popup 
is easy to use and you don't need programming skills. As a component 
Corner Popup needs only jquery to work. It is fully responsive without 
using any framework.

2. How to use
-------------

Using Corner Popup is very simple. As the first step, add jquery and
Corner Popup files for the project (remember to add appropriate
files to folders):

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/corner-popup.min.css">
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/corner-popup.min.js"></script>

As step 2 call script from your website code:

<script>
$.fn.cornerpopup({
});
</script>

In step 3 you can (but it's not necessary) set some options
in previously added code:

<script>
$.fn.cornerpopup({
variant: 1,
slide: 1
});
</script>
